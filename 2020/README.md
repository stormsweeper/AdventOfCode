# Advent of Code 2020

Cripes, what a year. Looking forward to the warm embrace of these puzzles.

I didn't really follow up on solving in multiple languages last year. I'm not going to promise that for 2020.

As before, general guidelines for solutions:
- Input is taken as a text file argument, unless the puzzle gives just a short list of inputs in which case they will be separate arguments
  - file input programs will be executed like `php solution.php input.txt`
  - non-file inputs will be `php solution.php input1 input 2 input3 ...`
- Output is printed to stdout
- "Core" modules only
- Descriptive variables and verbose code; I'm not playing golf here
- Code is nonetheless not engineered any more than needed for that day

I'll try to do the first-pass solution in the same day the puzzle is opened. I'm not shooting for the leaderboard, though.
