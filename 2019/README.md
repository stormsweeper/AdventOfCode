# Advent of Code 2019

Another year, another AoC. This year my personal challenge will be to get in practice in other languages I'm less familiar with.

I'll still solve first in PHP, but will follow up in others. This will allow me to focus on the "fun" bits in the right places â€“ I can work out the general algorithms in a langauge I am very fluent in, and then build up an equivalent in others I am less so.

My general guidelines for solutions:
- Input is taken as a text file argument, unless the puzzle gives just a short list of inputs in which case they will be separate arguments
- Output is printed to stdout
- "Core" modules only
- Descriptive variables and verbose code; I'm not playing golf here
- Code is nonetheless not engineered any more than needed for that day

I'll try to do the PHP solution in the same day the puzzle is opened. I'm not shooting for the leaderboard, though.
